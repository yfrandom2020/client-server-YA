# Establishing connection
This project assumes two things: the server and client are on the same LAN and their IP and port are unknown to each other. To solve this problem the client first sends a UDP broadcast message across the LAN containing that says 'Client' and contains his IP. From the moment the server is up, he opens a thread to handle these types of broadcast messages. The server uses scapy to sniff packets that answer the following requirement (UDP broadcast) and sends them back a UDP message containing the IP and port he sits on. After the client sends his broadcast message he listens on said port for a reply from the server.
